This edge detector is easy to start up. Simply run “python.py”, and then when prompted, type in the file name with its extension. Example: “lena.jpg” but without the quotes. 5 files will then be saved into the directory.

I apologize for the late turn in. I’ve had the program working for about a week now but never turned it in. I understand the penalties, and this won’t happen again.
